                        <li> Some schools & institutions require the client (you) to pay for return shipping. Please
                            bring an envelope & postage for us to use.
                        </li>
                        <li> Consider the time needed to mail the exam (each way) and grade the exam when scheduling
                            appointments on tight deadlines

                        <li className="title">What do I need to bring?</li>
                        <li>You will need to bring proper identification (see above) and a good attitude! A small snack or water is also encouraged. We will have everything else you will need to take the test.</li>

                        <li>The exam time is dependent on the exam itself. Every exam we do for others' schools is different and a UT High School test is certainly different from the University of Buffalo.</li>
